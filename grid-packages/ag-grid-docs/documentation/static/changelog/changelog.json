Server Side Row Model Changes","versions":["25.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":["SSRM"],"moreInformation":"The Server-Side Row Model (SSRM) has received a huge update with regards how it works to allow all of the following features:\r\n\r\n+ Ability to turn off infinite scrolling, so all rows are read back for a particular group. This was implemented by introducing the concepts of Row Stores. The Partial Store provides Infinite Scrolling (backwards compatible approach) and the Full Store reads all records in one go without using Infinite Scrolling. The concept of Full Store (reading all rows at once) paved the way for SSRM Transactions and Client Side Sorting & Filtering. See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-row-stores/\r\n\r\n+ Sorting and Filtering now occur on the client side rather than the server side if all rows are read back from the server (via the Full Store). See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-sorting/ and https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-filtering/\r\n\r\n+ Support for Transactions to allow Updates, Inserts and Removes of data on the client side. See\r\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-transactions/\r\n\r\n+ Support for Async Transactions to allow a high frequency of Updates, Inserts and Removes. This is brilliant for showing updates to large data that is changing at a rapid pace (eg many updates per second). See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-high-frequency/\r\n\r\n+ Refreshing of rows (as opposed to purging) to allow reloading rows in the background without showing loading spinners to the user. See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-refresh/\r\n\r\n+ Refreshing of rows doesn't lose group state if groups are expanded. See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-refresh/#group-state\r\n\r\n+ Failed fetching of data can now be retried at a later point. See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-retry/\r\n\r\n+ Groups can now be opened by default using the grid callback isServerSideGroupOpenByDefault(). See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-grouping/#open-by-default\r\n\r\n+ New API for expanding all groups, see https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-grouping/#expand-all--collapse-all\r\n\r\n+ Customisation of Store (Cache) properties at different levels. Eg have block size of 100 on top level, and 500 on lower levels. Or use Full Store at top levels and Partial Store at other levels. See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-grouping/#configure-stores\r\n\r\n+ 'Store Info' can be provided when loads complete, which can then be viewed using Store State. See https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript/server-side-model-grouping/#store-state--store-info\r\n\r\n\r\n","deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":"These two breaking changes only apply if using the Server-Side Row Model.\r\n\r\n1) There is a new property serverSideStoreType which must be set to 'partial'. Stores are a new concept and there are two store types, 'partial' and 'full'. It was decided to make 'full' the default despite this decision creating a breaking change. The reason is that 'full' is what most people will probably use and is easier to learn before moving to 'partial', thus it's a breaking change for all current users with the value of simplifying how the SSRM works.\r\n\r\n2) The undocumented property RowNode.childrenCache is now called RowNode.childStore. As this is an undocumented property, nobody should be using it. However if you are using it, it's now changed.\r\n\r\n3) purgeServerSideCache is deprecated, replaced with refreshServerSideStore which provides the same functionality but with purge=true as an option. This allows for silent refreshes without showing the loading indicator, but instead updating the data in place.","documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2823","issueType":"Task","summary":"[Charts] Add Integrated Cross Filtering","versions":["25.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":["Cross_Filtering"],"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2605","issueType":"Task","summary":"[SSRM] Allow for cacheBlockSize to take -1, meaning try to get everything from the backend in one go.","versions":["25.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":["SSRM"],"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-1543","issueType":"Task","summary":"[Keyboard Navigation] Allow using keyboard navigation to access elements hosted inside column headers","versions":["25.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":["Keyboard_Navigation"],"moreInformation":"See this demonstrated here:\r\n1.

Values\r\n#####################################\r\n\r\nColumn definitions now have 'initial' values for all stateful items.\r\n\r\nThe full list of 'initial' values is as follows:\r\n\r\ninitialWidth\r\ninitialFlex\r\ninitialHide\r\ninitialSort\r\ninitialSortIndex\r\ninitialAggFunc\r\ninitialPivot\r\ninitialPivotIndex\r\ninitialRowGroup\r\ninitialRowGroupIndex\r\ninitialPinned\r\n\r\nWhen a Column Definition includes an initial value, it is applied when the column is created only. It is not applied when column definitions are updated.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding non-initial values are always applied, even during columns updates.\r\n\r\nFor example the column definition attribute \"width\" is used when the column is created or any time the column definitions are updated after creation. The column definition attribute \"initialWidth\" is used when the column is created only.\r\n\r\n\r\n#####################################\r\n# Gone - Immutable Columns - No longer needed\r\n#####################################\r\n\r\nThe grid property \"immutableColumns\" is gone. The behavior this property set is now the default (with the exception of column order, mentioned below).\r\n\r\nIn the old design, when updating column definitions, if \"immutableColumns=false\" then column state information (width, pinned, rowGroup etc) would not be applied, as that is only applied when columns are created. By setting. If \"immutableColumns=true\", then column state information WAS applied.\r\n\r\nIn the new design, as explained above, each state property has two variants, a \"normal\" and a \"initial\". This allows selectively applying state on creates vs updates of columns, thus \"immutableColumns\" is redundant.\r\n\r\nThe only additional benefit to \"immutableColumns\" was that it applied the order of the column definitions when they were updated. To have the order applied when column definitions are updated, set the new grid property \"applyColumnDefOrder=true\".\r\n\r\n#####################################\r\n# Column State Changes\r\n#####################################\r\n\r\nColumn State management has been refactored to be more flexible. A new documentation page dedicated to Column State is available here:\r\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-state/\r\n\r\nData returned back from gridApi.getColumnState() now additionally has the following attributes: pivot, rowGroup, sort and sortedAt.\r\n\r\ngridApi.setColumnState(state) is now deprecated and replaced with gridApi.applyColumnState(params). This allows additional parameters to be passed to the API on top of just the state.\r\n\r\nTo move your code over to the new API without changing your applications functionality, instead of calling setColumnState(state), call applyColumnState({state: columnState, applyOrder: true}.\r\n\r\nWhen applying column state, applying the order of the columns is now optional and specified via params.applyOrder.\r\n\r\nWhey applying Column State, Columns in the grid for which no state is provided will be left untouched - previously they would be cleared of all state. Optionally a Default Column State can be applied to Columns where no state is provided.\r\n\r\nWhy applying Column State, it is now possible to have attributes not applied. Eg if Column State only includes Sort information, other Column State (Row Group, Width etc) will not be impacted.\r\n\r\nThe above items result in fine grained control of Column State via getColumnState() and applyColumnState() methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n#####################################\r\n# Property suppressSetColumnStateEvents Renamed To suppressColumnStateEvents\r\n#####################################\r\n\r\nIf using property suppressSetColumnStateEvents, simply replace with property suppressColumnStateEvents.\r\n\r\n#####################################\r\n# ColDef.sortedAt replaced with ColDef.sortIndex\r\n#####################################\r\n\r\nIf you want to sort many columns then use sortIndex rather than sortedAt to specify the order of the sorting.\r\n\r\n#####################################\r\n# Sort State\r\n#####################################\r\n\r\ngridApi.getSortModel() and gridApi.setSortModel() are deprecated. Sort state is now included in Column State, thus use columnApi.getColumnState() and columnApi.applyColumnState() instead.\r\n\r\n","deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":"See 'More Info' for full details, these changes make more sense in context of the wider changes.\r\n\r\n1) Column stateful items (width, flex, hide, sort, aggFunc, pivot, pivotIndex, rowGroup, rowGorupIndex, intitialPinned) always get re-applied when Column Definitions are updated.\r\n\r\n2) Grid Property 'immutableColumns' is now gone. Columns are immutable by default.\r\n\r\n3) Grid API 'getColumnState()' now returns back more information about columns. This is only a breaking change if your application isn't able to work with the extra details.\r\n\r\n4) Grid API 'setColumnsState()' is replaced with 'applyColumnState()'. The new method is similar but more powerful / flesible.\r\n\r\n5) Grid Property 'suppressSetColumnStateEvents' renamed to 'suppressColumnStateEvents'\r\n\r\n6) Column Definition property sortedAt replaced with sortIndex\r\n\r\n7) Grid API's 'getSortModel()' and 'setSortModel()' are deprecated as sort information is now part of Column State.

fix.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening is browser is scrolling the main content using the GPU. In other words, the user is scrolling the rows left/right, by using middle mouse button scrolling, or touchpad scrolling. The GPU scrolls the rows left/right natively before firing off any events. Then the grid listens to the events and updates the position of the header. However the same GPU hardware scrolling cannot be used here, as the header is not getting natively scrolled.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the grid to scroll the header in sync with the rows as the browsers is scrolling first the rows with GPU, then firing events second. Because of this two stage process, there is nothing the grid can do, as by the time it receives the event, it is to late.\r\n\r\nWe tried to disable the GPU scrolling, however we cannot find any CSS setting to stop the GPU from getting used. It is beyond CSS & JavaScript to change this.\r\n\r\nYou can also observe this between browsers that work 'well' and 'not well'. Where it does not work well, the header and rows get out of sync, however the rows are scrolling far more smoothly. Where it works well, both the header and the rows scroll at the same speed so always in sync, however the rows don't scroll as smoothly. So it's a tradeoff. In testing we found Chrome on Windows the rows and header kept in sync but rows did not scroll smoothly, however in Chrome on Mac we found the rows and header did not keep in sync, but rows did scroll smoothly.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we introduced a property, to allow the application to choose if it wanted smooth scrolling, or synced headers / rows, however as mentioned, we could not find any CSS or JavaScript to allow this to happen.

Because of this, functionality was extended onto them again and again. To reduce technical dept we decided to rewrite the filters again, now that we have gathered all the requirements over the years. The new filters should be more bullet proof (many bugs were fixed on the way) and lay the foundation for future enhancements by us (the old design was stretched with regards extension). We tried out best to keep the API interface, filter models,  etc to limit breaking changes. The one change we had to do was with regards custom floating filters (as described in the breaking changes section). Changes (fixes) to the filter interface include the following:\r\n\r\n1. FoatingFilter interface simplified (see breaking change).\r\n2. Filter interface IFilter had items in it relating to the provided filters, eg properties applyButton, clearButton, debounceMs should never of been in IFilter. The IFilter interface is for data the grid passes to the filter. If you want more details in this interface, you should extend it. So if you were using IFilter and expecting applyButton parameter, this is no longer there. To get these parameters, you should use the specific filter type interface eg ITextFilterParams, IDateFilterParams, INumberFilterParams or ISetFilterParams.\r\n3. The Filter Model interfaces were cleaned up to be correct. Your code should not have to change, this was internal hierarchical structuring changes and adding optional to some items.\r\n\r\nThe new Filter code inside ag-Grid is more readable and easier to reason with. This will make people who look at the ag-Grid code happy, understanding how it all works will be easier, and troubleshooting issues will be easier.","deprecationNotes":"### Column Filters\r\nThere is one change with regards configuring standard filters. NullComparator is replaced with more aptly named properties: includeBlanksInEquals, includeBlanksInLessThan and includeBlanksInGreaterThan. If you were not configuring a NullComparator, then there is nothing to do. See the docs on 'Date and Number Filters and Blank Cells' in Column Filters page.\r\n\r\n### Floating Filters\r\nFloatingFilters now work differently. If you created your own custom floating filter components, then there are breaking changes that are detailed here. If you did NOT provide customer floating filter components, then you only need to be ware of point 1 below with regards the debounceMs property.\r\n\r\nIf building your own floating filters, see the revised documentation on how to implement custom floating filters.\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCustom Floating Filter Breaking Change #1: Props for Provided Floating Filters\r\n\r\nFor the provided floating filters, FloatingFilterParams.debounceMs is gone. Instead it reuses the debounceMs from the parent filter. You don't need to specify debounceMs twice.\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCustom Floating Filter Breaking Change #2: params.onParentModelChanged => <custom>\r\n\r\nWhen the user changes the floating filter, the floating filter used to call params.onParentModelChanged(parentModel) and pass the filter model. Now instead it is possible for the floating filter to get and instance of the parent filter via params.parentFilterInstance() by which it can then call any method on the parent filter. The intention is that your custom parent filter will expose a method that you decided and the custom floating filter will call this method directly. There is no need for the grid to act as a go-between the floating and parent filters.\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCustom Floating Filter Breaking Change #3: IFloatingFilter.onParentModelChanged\r\n\r\nThe method:\r\nonParentModelChanged(model)\r\nIs now:\r\nonParentModelChanged(model, event)\r\n\r\nThat is, the FilterChangedEvent is passed to the floating filter, if it was a change in filter that caused the method to be called. This tied with #4 below allows the filter to pass details to the floating filter about the change.\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCustom Floating Filter Breaking Change #4:. Filter callback params.filterChangedCallback()\r\n\r\nThe Filter callback params.filterChangedCallback() now takes one parameters object (of type any). If provided, the contents of the object are added to the FilterChangedEvent class. This means the filter can augment the FilterChangedEvent by added custom elements.\r\n\r\nThe provided filters use a combination of #3 and #4 above to allow the filters to pass information to the floating filters when the filter is changed.\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCustom Floating Filter Breaking Change #5: IFloatingFilter Interface Generics\r\n\r\nNow the IFloatingFilter interface takes no generics. Having generics here was a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe old interface was:\r\n\r\nexport interface IFloatingFilter<M, F extends FloatingFilterChange, P extends IFloatingFilterParams<M, F>> {\r\n    onParentModelChanged(parentModel: any): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new interface is:\r\n\r\nexport interface IFloatingFilter {\r\n    onParentModelChanged(parentModel: any, filterChangedEvent?: FilterChangedEvent): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\n","breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2941","issueType":"Bug","summary":"When applying a formatter and a getter on a display group column, the value 'undefined' is shown","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2940","issueType":"Bug","summary":"When applying a formatter and a getter to a source column used for grouping, only the formatter gets applied","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Rejected","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2938","issueType":"Bug","summary":"When filtering using server side row model + pagination + column filtering, while the column filter data is loaded the pagination information shows invalid information","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2936","issueType":"Bug","summary":"Setting floating filter height to 0 doesn’t hide the floating filter (-1 does hide it)","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2931","issueType":"Bug","summary":"When caseSensitive: false, text floating filter transforms uppercase to lowercase","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2930","issueType":"Bug","summary":"When using Full width group rows + group footer the total row does not show the count of totals","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2926","issueType":"Bug","summary":"Viewport row model - Last request for setViewportRange index is off by 1","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2922","issueType":"Bug","summary":"groupIncludeTotalFooter: true causes an error to be thrown when combined with pivot mode.","versions":["21.0.0"],"status":"Done","resolution":"Done","features":null,"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2921","issueType":"Bug","summary":"When pinning right + reducing to minimum column width or cell content aligned to the right.
